## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious engineer who loves building systems that feel **clean, intentional and kind to the next person reading the code**.  
I value clear thinking, collaborative problem-solving, and a bit of humour along the way.

Outside work, you'll usually find me exploring tech, learning new tools, playing Pokémon anything and occasionally obsessing over narwhals 🐋🦄
